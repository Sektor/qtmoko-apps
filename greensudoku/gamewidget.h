 * \brief Widget that show a Sudoku board and manage the game.
 *
 * This widget shows a Sudoku board. It is begun with the 
 * QSudoku::startBeginner(),QSudoku::startIntermediate() and 
 * QSudoku::startExpert() methods. 
 * When the user stops the game (whether it is the end or a pause), 
 * the game state is stored and it is restored when the user 
 * restarts the application.
 *
 * A game can be continued if it was left the last time 
 * the application was launched with the QSudoku::continueGame() method.
 * A game can be restarted with the QSudoku::restartGame() method. 
 * This removes the numbers set by the user.
 *
 * A completed board is signaled with the QSudoku::gameEnded() signal.
 *
 * A note on the implementation: This class act as a controller 
 * in a MVC paradigm. The model is represented by the Grid class and
 * the views are the GridView and NumberView classes.
